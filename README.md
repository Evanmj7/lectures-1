# Big Data in Economics (EC 410/510)

This is a Masters-level course taught by [Grant McDermott](http://grantmcdermott.com) at the University of Oregon. It is a condensed version of a [related course](https://github.com/uo-ec607/lectures) (with some additions) that I teach at the PhD level. 

Please read the [syllabus](https://github.com/uo-ec510-2020-spring/syllabus/blob/master/syllabus.pdf) first. This will detail software requirements and installation, and give you a better sense of the aims and scope of the course.
